### :speech_balloon: My Aswers to Questions

1. I spent 2 days on this coding test. I would like to add Java Currency Library, and Test Cases with Junit and Cucumber. Also, improve some error handling and be more specific about income and outcome money (on transactions).
2. Lambda expressions and Base64 encoding are also great, but I didn't use base64 in this specific project (could be used for JWT).
````java
       RatpackServer.start(server -> server  
            .serverConfig(getServerConfig())  
            .registry(Guice.registry(m -> m  
                    .module(ErrorModule.class)  
                    .module(ApiModule.class)  
                    .module(ServiceModule.class)))  
            .handlers(handler -> handler  
                    .insert(ApiEndpoints.class)));

3. I love SpringBoot, but of course, they have different approaches and objectives. The main reason that I love SpringBoot is the community, it is big, easy to get information about anything.
4. Java 8. I am used to working with Java 6 so I want to get more and more information about the new java versions and also improve my knowledge regarding development with Java/cloud microservices and get more knowledge about the front end (with React)
5. The first is to understand how the system works and get all possible information about when, how,  why, and where it happens. if it happens during rush times if it is a specific job. I had to do this with hibernate once, where all the queries were EAGER instead of LAZY and it was making the system very slow. I would try to implement Jmeter, but honestly, I've never used it.
6. First, use the correct Monetary system for the system. Get specific error handling, and insert optional debug logs (log into database important flags as it is a monetary service).
7.

8. There is no meaning to life and that is the beauty of it, just like an empty page ready to be written. sometimes a sad history, sometimes a happy one. Life is, we like it or not, just a moment where we can be the best to ourselves while invisible to the entire universe.
